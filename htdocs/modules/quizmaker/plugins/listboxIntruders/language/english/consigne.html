This slide presents 1 to 3 lists.<br>
In the case of a single list, it is a question of eliminating the items which do not correspond to the criteria stated in the question.<br>
If there are several lists, the items must be grouped according to the criteria corresponding to the titles of the lists<br>
In case there are 3 lists, the items are moved on the list
next and for the third to the first list.. It will therefore be necessary
perhaps move an item several times to bring it to the correct
group.<br>
Depending on the setting options, you will have to click or double click to move the items.<br>
